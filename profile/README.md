DOGE Website Promises Savings Updates by Valentine’s Day
---

Elon Musk’s official government website for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was updated on Wednesday and no longer features only a logo.

The site now prominently features a feed of X posts made by DOGE, along with sections breaking down what appears to be publicly available data on the government workforce — along with a message promising an update on “savings” by Valentine’s Day, which is Friday.

The update comes three weeks after the website’s initial launch and less than 24 hours after Musk told ABC News’ Rachel Scott on Tuesday that DOGE posts “our actions to the DOGE Handle on X and to the DOGE website,” while the website was still blank.

## Transparency and Savings Goals

The “Savings” section, which would likely show DOGE’s progress toward Musk’s goal of halving the $2 trillion deficit by next year, currently promises updates by Friday.

## Workforce Insights

The “Workforce” section provides a breakdown of staffing across the federal government, based on public data posted by the Office of Personnel Management. The page invites users to “Trace your tax dollars through the bureaucracy.”
